# recipeBox-V2 
The project manager has returned to you with a heavy sigh and a long face. "They want to add the ability to edit recipes and have a favorites collection." Here's how that breaks down:

  Edit Recipes
  • create a form for editing existing recipes that pre-populates with the information of the model being updated
  • the logged in user can edit their recipes
  • the admin user can edit all recipes
  Favorite Recipes
  • every user has a collection of favorite recipes
  • links to favorites viewable from author detail page
  • all recipes have a favorite button on them; after all, you might want to favorite your own amazing cookies
  • favorite button is visible only if logged in
  Misc
  • cannot ask questions about code base from creator
  • cannot break site, cannot widely refactor
  • can clean up code blocks touched
